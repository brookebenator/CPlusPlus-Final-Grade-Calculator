# CPlusPlus-Final-Grade-Calculator

This final grade calculator was made in my Introduction to C++ class. It uses the real point system given by the professor to calculate ones final grade. The user is asked to input the amount of any points they have received and any extra credit, and the output will be the final letter and number grade.
